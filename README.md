## My projects

- ### ${\color{blue}Test Constructor Platform}$
## Overview

This project is a full-featured platform for creating and managing online tests.  
It allows registered users to design their own tests, edit and manage them, share tests with candidates, and review completed results with detailed evaluations.

The application is designed as a tool for recruiters, teachers, and team leads who need a convenient way to assess candidates or students through customizable testing workflows.

---

## Key Features

- User registration and authentication  
- Creating custom tests with flexible structure  
- Editing and managing existing tests  
- Viewing created tests  
- Generating and sharing test links with candidates  
- Collecting completed test results  
- Viewing detailed candidate answers and scores  
- Decision-making based on test performance  
- Secure access to private user data  

---

## Tech Stack

### Front-end

- **Next.js 16 (SSR)**
- **TypeScript**
- **HTML**
- **SCSS Modules**
- **Framer Motion** – animations
- **SweetAlert (Swal)** – notifications
- **Jest + React Testing Library** – unit and integration testing

Initially, Next.js Route Handlers were used, but for more удобной and flexible work with JWT tokens and cookies, the backend logic was moved to a separate Express server.

To protect routes and manage authentication flow:

- `proxy.ts` is used for protected routes  
- Custom middleware with `rewrites` handles cookies and refresh token logic  

---

### Back-end

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB**
- **Mongoose**
- **JWT authentication**
- **Access & Refresh Tokens**
- **Cookie-based authorization**

The backend provides secure authentication, token rotation, and protected API endpoints for managing users, tests, and results.

---

## CI/CD and Deployment

The project uses a CI/CD pipeline configured via a `.yml` file.  
GitHub repository settings and branch protection rules are applied to ensure stable and safe deployment:

- Automated builds and tests on pull requests  
- Deployment only after successful CI checks  
- Branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to main branches  
- Code review requirements before merging  

This setup helps maintain code quality and prevents unstable versions from being deployed to production.

---

## Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project is to provide a convenient and secure tool for:

- evaluating candidates  
- automating testing processes  
- simplifying decision-making based on structured test results
